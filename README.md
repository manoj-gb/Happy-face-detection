# Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to distinguish between different classes of images, and the provided function can be used to classify new images and display them with their predicted labels.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `images/`: Directory to store sample images for classification.
- `model/`: Contains the trained model and related code.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- H5py
- Pillow

You can install the required packages using pip:
